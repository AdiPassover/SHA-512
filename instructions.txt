This is a group project, the size of the group is 2. (if both are regular students), or 3 (if you have a recognized reservr duty student in your group)

The project consists of 3 parts:

1.  (5 points) Literature search

2.(30 points) Programming and testing

3.(15 points) Theory test



After you choose your topic, you need to find 5 or more sources: standards, tech reports,

( test data sets, key choice recommendations, research articles etc)

    For standards, I recommend NIST web site, and RFC documents 

After you find literature, you need to show it to me and explain why is it relevant and useful for you. Then you can start programming.

After your program is ready, working, and undergoes standard tests (if those exist for your topic), you come to me and defend your project (I need to make sure it is working correctly, and you know what you did).
